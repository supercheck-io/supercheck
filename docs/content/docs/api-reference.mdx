# API Overview

Supercheck’s REST API lets you automate routine tasks, sync results to other systems, and trigger activity from your own tooling. This page explains everything a developer needs to get started without diving into low-level implementation details.

## Before You Begin

<Steps>
  <Step>Confirm you have the `Owner` or `Admin` role in your workspace.</Step>
  <Step>Decide which project or team the integration should operate within.</Step>
  <Step>Create a dedicated service account if you need auditable access separation.</Step>
</Steps>

## Create an API Key

1. Go to **Settings → API access**.
2. Click **Generate key** and give it a descriptive name (e.g., “CI Smoke Tests”).
3. Choose the scopes you need:
   - `tests:read` / `tests:write` for managing scripted checks
   - `jobs:execute` for triggering jobs
   - `monitors:read` for pulling uptime data
4. Store the generated token in your secrets manager — you will not see it again.

<Callout type="tip">
  Rotate API keys at least every 90 days. Create separate keys per environment
  so you can revoke access safely if needed.
</Callout>

</Cards>

## Making Secure Requests

- Use the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header on every request.
- Send requests over HTTPS only; Supercheck rejects plain HTTP.
- Scope keys narrowly — for example, avoid write permissions if you only need to read status data.

## Helpful Endpoints

| Goal | Endpoint | Notes |
| ---- | -------- | ----- |
| List tests | `GET /api/tests` | Filter by tag to target specific suites |
| Trigger job | `POST /api/jobs/{jobId}/run` | Include a release tag to trace the execution |
| Check monitor status | `GET /api/monitors/{id}` | Returns latest uptime and incident info |
| Fetch run details | `GET /api/runs/{id}` | Contains URLs to logs, screenshots, and playback |

<Callout type="note">
  Full OpenAPI specs and language SDKs are available from the **Developer
  Portal** link inside the app. They include authentication samples and error
  codes.

## Keep Integrations Healthy

- Monitor rate limit headers to avoid throttling; upgrade plans increase throughput if needed.
- Log request IDs (`X-Request-Id`) so support can help troubleshoot quickly.
- Review key usage in **Settings → API access** and revoke tokens that are no longer required.
