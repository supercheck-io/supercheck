## 1. Set Up Your Workspace

## 2. Invite Your Team

- Go to **Settings → Members** to add teammates by email
- Assign roles: `Owner` for platform admins, `Editor` for people running tests, `Viewer` for stakeholders
- Share the welcome checklist so everyone aligns on expectations

## 3. Connect Environments & Secrets

<Tabs items={['Environment URLs', 'Secrets', 'Notifications']}>
  <Tab value="Environment URLs">
    Add the base URLs your tests will use (e.g., production and staging). This
    keeps scripts portable and prevents hard-coded links.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Secrets">
    Store API keys and passwords as secrets. Supercheck encrypts values at rest
    and masks them in logs.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Notifications">
    Choose how you want to hear about important events: email, Slack, or your
    preferred webhook.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## 4. Run Your First Browser Journey

<Steps>
  <Step>Open **Tests → New Test** and pick the browser template.</Step>
  <Step>Fill in a friendly name like “Checkout flow” and add a short description.</Step>
  <Step>Paste or record the steps your customers take (login, purchase, etc.).</Step>
  <Step>Hit **Run Test** to trigger an instant execution.</Step>
  <Step>Review the result card — you will see screenshots, logs, and timing.</Step>
</Steps>
