Explore end-to-end execution traces with spans, timings, and artifacts to see exactly what happened in every run.

## Viewing Traces

### Accessing the Traces Page

<Steps>
  <Step>Go to **Observe → Traces**.</Step>
  <Step>Filter by project, test type, status, or time range.</Step>
  <Step>Select a trace to open its timeline and spans.</Step>
</Steps>

## Trace List View

Each row shows status, duration, timestamp, and span count with quick filters for project, type, status, and time.

## Trace Detail View

Open a trace to view:
- Timeline of spans with durations and statuses.
- Network calls (method, URL, status code).
- Browser actions and assertions (for Playwright).
- Attachments: screenshots, console/network logs, videos, traces.

## Understanding Spans

Each span in the timeline represents an operation with:
- Span name (e.g., "HTTP GET /api/users")
- Duration (e.g., "234ms")
- Start time (relative to test start)
- Status (OK, Error)
- Attributes (HTTP method, URL, status code, etc.)

## Analyzing Performance

<Steps>
  <Step>Sort spans by duration to spot slow steps.</Step>
  <Step>Check network spans for 4xx/5xx or high latency.</Step>
  <Step>Review waits/timeouts—long waits often hide flakiness.</Step>
  <Step>Identify sequential steps that could be parallelized.</Step>
</Steps>

## Exporting Traces

Export trace data for analysis:

<Steps>
  <Step>Open a trace detail view.</Step>
  <Step>Click **Export**.</Step>
  <Step>Choose JSON, CSV, or OTLP and download.</Step>
</Steps>
