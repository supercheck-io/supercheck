Explore detailed execution traces to understand test performance, debug failures, and optimize your automation.

## Viewing Traces

### Accessing the Traces Page

<Steps>
  <Step>Navigate to **Observe → Traces** from the sidebar</Step>
  <Step>View list of recent test executions with trace data</Step>
  <Step>Filter by project, test type, status, or time range</Step>
  <Step>Click any trace to view detailed execution timeline</Step>
</Steps>

## Trace List View

The traces page shows all test executions with key information:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Trace ID** | Unique identifier for this execution |
| **Test Name** | Name of the test that was executed |
| **Status** | Pass/Fail status |
| **Duration** | Total execution time |
| **Timestamp** | When the test ran |
| **Span Count** | Number of operations in the trace |

### Filtering Traces

Use filters to find specific traces:

- **Project**: Filter by project name
- **Test Type**: Browser, API, Database, Custom, Performance
- **Status**: Passed, Failed, Error
- **Time Range**: Last hour, 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, custom
- **Search**: Search by test name or trace ID

## Trace Detail View

Click any trace to see the complete execution timeline with all operations.

### Timeline Visualization

    section Test
    Test Execution         :active, root, 00:00:00, 15s

    section Browser

    Check Element Visible  :assert2, 00:00:13, 0.1s
```

## Understanding Spans

Each span in the timeline represents an operation with:
- Span name (e.g., "HTTP GET /api/users")
- Duration (e.g., "234ms")
- Start time (relative to test start)
- Status (OK, Error)
- Attributes (HTTP method, URL, status code, etc.)

## Analyzing Performance

<Steps>
  <Step>Sort spans by duration (longest first)</Step>
  <Step>Look for unexpectedly slow operations</Step>
  <Step>Check network requests for slow APIs</Step>
  <Step>Identify sequential operations that could be parallel</Step>
  <Step>Review wait times and timeouts</Step>
</Steps>

## Exporting Traces

Export trace data for analysis:

<Steps>
  <Step>Open trace detail view</Step>
  <Step>Click **Export** button</Step>
  <Step>Choose format: JSON, CSV, or OTLP</Step>
  <Step>Download trace data</Step>
</Steps>
