# Daily Workflows

Use these playbooks to stay ahead of issues, keep coverage fresh, and communicate clearly with your team.

## Morning Health Check

<Steps>
  <Step>Open the dashboard Overview to review pass rate, uptime, and active alerts.</Step>
  <Step>Scan the **Needs Attention** list and assign owners to anything red.</Step>
  <Step>Snooze known issues for a set window so the team avoids duplicate noise.</Step>
  <Step>Post a brief status update in your chosen channel if downtime is expected.</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="tip">
  Tag runs with release versions so you can correlate incident spikes with recent changes.

## Release Readiness

## Keeping Monitors Relevant

- Review monitors every sprint; pause anything you no longer need
- Adjust alert thresholds when you expand infrastructure or change SLAs
- Use maintenance windows during planned downtime to prevent noise
- Share public status page updates as soon as incidents start and end
