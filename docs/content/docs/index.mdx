## Why Teams Choose Supercheck

### Complete Testing Platform
Run Playwright browser tests, API validations, database checks, and k6 performance tests from a single platform. Schedule tests to run automatically or trigger them from your CI/CD pipeline.

### Intelligent Monitoring
Monitor your services from US East, EU Central, and Asia Pacific regions. Configure failure thresholds to avoid alert fatigue and get notified only when issues persist.

### AI-Powered Development
Generate complete test scripts from natural language descriptions. When tests fail, AI analyzes the error and suggests fixes—saving hours of debugging time.

### Incident Communication
Create branded public status pages for your users. Manage incidents with a clear workflow from investigation to resolution, and keep subscribers informed with automatic email notifications.

### Self-Hosted Control
Deploy on your own infrastructure with Docker Compose. Your data stays on your servers, and you control scaling, security, and access.
