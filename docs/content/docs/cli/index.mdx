icon: Terminal
---

The Supercheck CLI (`@supercheck/cli`) provides a first-class command-line interface for CI/CD pipelines, automation workflows, and monitoring-as-code. Built with TypeScript, it supports all major Supercheck operations — jobs, tests, monitors, variables, and more.

[View the package on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@supercheck/cli).

## Key Features

- **CI/CD Integration** — Trigger jobs, wait for results, and gate deployments
- **Monitoring-as-Code** — Define monitors, tests, and jobs in `supercheck.config.ts`
- **Full CRUD** — Manage all resources from the terminal
- **JSON Output** — Machine-readable output for scripting with `--json`
- **Retry & Rate Limiting** — Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- **Self-Hosted Support** — Works with any Supercheck deployment

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @supercheck/cli

# Authenticate
export SUPERCHECK_TOKEN="sck_live_..."
supercheck login --token $SUPERCHECK_TOKEN

# Verify connection
supercheck whoami
supercheck health

# List resources
supercheck job list
supercheck monitor list
supercheck test list
```

## How It Works

The CLI communicates with the Supercheck API using **CLI tokens** (`sck_live_*` prefix). These are project-scoped tokens that inherit the creating user's RBAC permissions.

```
supercheck.config.ts          → Defines resources (monitoring-as-code)
SUPERCHECK_TOKEN env var      → Authenticates API requests
supercheck deploy             → Pushes config to Supercheck API
supercheck job trigger <id>   → Triggers jobs from CI/CD
```

## Next Steps

- [Installation](./installation) — Install and set up the CLI
- [Authentication](./authentication) — Token types and security
- [Configuration](./configuration) — `supercheck.config.ts` reference
- [Commands](./commands) — Full command reference
- [CI/CD Integration](./ci-cd) — GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Docker
