Connect Supercheck to your delivery workflow, CI/CD pipelines, and external tools—securely and predictably.

<Callout type="info">
  Use scoped API keys and webhooks to trigger jobs, fetch results, and push status where your team works.
</Callout>

## Overview

Pick the integration path that fits your team:

- **API**: Trigger jobs, fetch runs, and stream results.
- **CI/CD**: Gate deployments with jobs/tests in GitHub Actions, GitLab, Jenkins, and friends.
- **Webhooks**: Receive real-time notifications and pipe them to chat/incident tools.
- **Scoped Keys**: Job-scoped API keys with rotation and auditing.

## Common Patterns

### Continuous Testing

Run tests automatically on every code change:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Code Push] --> B[CI/CD Pipeline]
    B --> C[Build Application]
    C --> D[Deploy to Staging]
    D --> E[Trigger Supercheck Tests]
    E --> F{Tests Pass?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Deploy to Production]
    F -->|No| H[Block Deployment]
    H --> I[Send Notification]

    style A fill:#3b82f6,color:#fff
    style G fill:#10b981,color:#fff
    style H fill:#ef4444,color:#fff
```

### Scheduled Monitoring

Run tests on a schedule to catch regressions:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A[Cron Schedule] --> B[Trigger Job]
    B --> C[Run Tests]
    C --> D{All Pass?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Continue Monitoring]
    D -->|No| F[Send Alert]
    F --> G[Create Incident]
    F --> H[Notify Team]
    E --> I[Update Dashboard]

    style A fill:#3b82f6,color:#fff
    style E fill:#10b981,color:#fff
    style F fill:#ef4444,color:#fff
```

### Post-Deployment Validation

Verify deployment success with automated tests:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant CD as CI/CD
    participant App as Application
    participant SC as Supercheck
    participant Team as Team

    CD->>App: Deploy new version
    App-->>CD: Deployment complete
    CD->>SC: Trigger smoke tests
    SC->>App: Run test suite
    SC-->>CD: Test results

    alt Tests Pass
        SC->>Team: ✓ Deployment validated
        CD->>CD: Mark deployment successful
    else Tests Fail
        SC->>Team: ✗ Tests failed
        CD->>App: Rollback deployment
        SC->>Team: Alert sent
    end
```

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Create an API Key

<Steps>
  <Step>Navigate to the Job you want to trigger remotely</Step>
  <Step>Go to the **API Keys** tab</Step>
  <Step>Click **Create API Key**</Step>
  <Step>Name your key (e.g., "GitHub Actions CI")</Step>
  <Step>Copy the generated API key (shown only once!)</Step>
  <Step>Store the key securely in your CI/CD secrets</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Trigger Jobs via API

Use the API key to trigger jobs:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.supercheck.io/jobs/{job-id}/trigger \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Step 3: Monitor Results

Poll for results or use webhooks for real-time updates:

```bash
# Get run status
curl https://api.supercheck.io/runs/{run-id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Security Best Practices

### API Key Management

<Steps>
  <Step>Never commit API keys to source control</Step>
  <Step>Store keys in CI/CD secrets or environment variables</Step>
  <Step>Use separate keys for different environments</Step>
  <Step>Rotate keys regularly</Step>
  <Step>Revoke unused or compromised keys immediately</Step>
</Steps>

### Access Control

- **Job-Specific Keys**: Each API key is scoped to a single job
- **Least Privilege**: Create separate keys for different purposes
- **Audit Trail**: All API requests are logged with key identifier
- **Expiration**: Set expiration dates for temporary access

## Integration Examples

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
name: Run Supercheck Tests
on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Trigger Supercheck Job
        run: |
          curl -X POST https://api.supercheck.io/jobs/${{ secrets.JOB_ID }}/trigger \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.SUPERCHECK_API_KEY }}"
```

### GitLab CI

```yaml
test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - |
      curl -X POST https://api.supercheck.io/jobs/${JOB_ID}/trigger \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer ${SUPERCHECK_API_KEY}"
```

### Jenkins

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh '''
                    curl -X POST https://api.supercheck.io/jobs/${JOB_ID}/trigger \
                      -H "Authorization: Bearer ${SUPERCHECK_API_KEY}"
                '''
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Webhook Integration

Receive real-time notifications:

<Steps>
  <Step>Configure webhook URL in notification settings</Step>
  <Step>Select events to receive (job completion, failures, etc.)</Step>
  <Step>Implement webhook endpoint to receive POST requests</Step>
  <Step>Process test results and take action</Step>
</Steps>

Example webhook payload:

```json
{
  "event": "job.completed",
  "job_id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
  "run_id": "987fcdeb-51a2-43f8-b123-456789abcdef",
  "status": "failed",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "results": {
    "total_tests": 10,
    "passed": 8,
    "failed": 2,
    "duration_ms": 45000
  }
}
```

## Rate Limiting

API requests are rate limited to ensure system stability:

- **Default Limit**: 100 requests per hour per API key
- **Burst Limit**: 10 requests per minute
- **Headers**: Rate limit info returned in response headers

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1642252800
```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Errors

<Callout type="warning">
  **401 Unauthorized**: Invalid or expired API key
</Callout>

**Solutions**:
- Verify API key is correct
- Check key hasn't been revoked
- Ensure key is enabled
- Verify key is for the correct job

### Rate Limit Exceeded

<Callout type="warning">
  **429 Too Many Requests**: Rate limit exceeded
</Callout>

**Solutions**:
- Implement exponential backoff
- Reduce request frequency
- Contact support for higher limits
- Use webhooks instead of polling

### Job Not Found

<Callout type="warning">
  **404 Not Found**: Job doesn't exist or no access
</Callout>

**Solutions**:
- Verify job ID is correct
- Check API key has access to this job
- Ensure job hasn't been deleted
