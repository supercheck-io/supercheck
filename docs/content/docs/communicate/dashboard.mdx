## Key Metrics

| Metric | Description |

| **Total Tests** | Test cases in your project |
| **Active Jobs** | Scheduled or running jobs |
| **Active Monitors** | Enabled monitoring endpoints |
| **Total Runs** | Job executions (last 7 days) |
| **Execution Time** | Total test time (last 7 days) |

## Charts

### Job Runs
Bar chart showing successful vs failed job runs over the last 7 days.

### Monitor Status
Current health distribution of all monitors (Up/Down).

### Test Types
Pie chart breakdown of test types (Browser, API, Database, Custom).

### Job Activity
Stacked area chart showing job triggers by type:
- **Manual** — User-initiated runs
- **Scheduled** — Cron-based runs
- **Remote** — API-triggered runs

### Uptime Trend
Line chart showing monitor uptime percentage over 7 days.

## Best Practices

1. Review key metrics daily
2. Check Job Runs chart for failure patterns
3. Monitor Uptime Trend for reliability
4. Use Test Activity to track development velocity
