## Charts

### Job Runs
Bar chart showing successful vs failed job runs over the last 7 days. Quickly identify failure patterns and trends.

### Monitor Status
Current health distribution of all monitors:
- **Up** — Monitors passing health checks
- **Down** — Monitors failing health checks

### Test Types
Pie chart breakdown of test types in your project:
- Browser, API, Database, Custom, Performance

### Job Activity
Stacked area chart showing job triggers by type:
- **Manual** — User-initiated runs
- **Scheduled** — Cron-based runs
- **Remote** — API-triggered runs (CI/CD)

### Uptime Trend
Line chart showing monitor uptime percentage over 7 days. Track reliability trends over time.

## Best Practices

- **Review daily** — Check key metrics for anomalies
- **Investigate failures** — Use Job Runs chart to spot patterns
- **Track uptime** — Monitor Uptime Trend for SLA compliance
- **Balance triggers** — Use Job Activity to ensure scheduled runs are working
