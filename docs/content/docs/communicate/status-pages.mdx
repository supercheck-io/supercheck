## Best Practices

**Incident Communication:**
- Be transparent — share what you know
- Update regularly — even if no progress
- Use clear language — avoid technical jargon
- Set expectations — provide estimated resolution times

**Component Organization:**
- Use clear, user-friendly names
- Keep the list focused (5-15 components)
- Add descriptions for context
