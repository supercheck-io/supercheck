### Incident Workflow

The incident lifecycle follows a clear progression from detection to resolution:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Investigating: Issue Detected
    Investigating --> Identified: Root Cause Found
    Identified --> Monitoring: Fix Deployed
    Monitoring --> Resolved: Confirmed Stable
    Resolved --> [*]

    [*] --> Scheduled: Plan Maintenance
    Scheduled --> Monitoring: Maintenance Complete

    note right of Investigating
        Team investigating
        root cause
    end note

    note right of Identified
        Working on fix
    end note

    note right of Monitoring
        Monitoring stability
    end note

    note right of Resolved
        Issue resolved
    end note
```

**Status Progression**:
1. **Investigating**: Issue detected, team investigating root cause
2. **Identified**: Root cause found, working on fix
3. **Monitoring**: Fix applied, monitoring for stability
4. **Resolved**: Issue completely resolved
5. **Scheduled**: For planned maintenance

### Adding Incident Updates

Keep users informed with timeline updates:

<Steps>
  <Step>Open an existing incident</Step>
  <Step>Click **Add Update**</Step>
  <Step>Write update message describing current status</Step>
  <Step>Update incident status if needed</Step>
  <Step>Choose whether to send notifications</Step>
  <Step>Save the update</Step>
</Steps>

### Scheduled Maintenance

Communicate planned maintenance in advance:

<Steps>
  <Step>Create incident with status **Scheduled**</Step>
  <Step>Set scheduled start and end times</Step>
  <Step>Enable automatic status transitions</Step>
  <Step>Configure reminder notifications (3, 6, 12, 24 hours before)</Step>
  <Step>System automatically updates status during maintenance window</Step>
</Steps>

## Component Status Types

### Operational (Green)
All systems functioning normally. No issues detected.

### Degraded Performance (Yellow)
Service is running but slower than normal. Minor issues affecting performance.

### Partial Outage (Orange)
Some features or services are unavailable. Partial functionality remains.

### Major Outage (Red)
Service is completely down or severely impaired. Critical issue.

### Under Maintenance (Blue)
Scheduled maintenance in progress. Temporary service interruption.

## Subscriber Management

### Email Subscriptions

Users can subscribe to your status page:

1. User visits your public status page
2. Clicks "Subscribe to Updates"
3. Enters email address
4. Receives verification email
5. Clicks verification link
6. Subscribed and receives future updates

## Linking Components to Monitors

### Automatic Status Updates

Link components to monitors for automatic status propagation:

<Steps>
  <Step>Edit a component</Step>
  <Step>Select one or more monitors to link</Step>
  <Step>Choose aggregation method (worst case, best case, weighted average)</Step>
  <Step>Set failure threshold (how many monitors must fail)</Step>
  <Step>Save configuration</Step>
</Steps>

### Aggregation Methods

**Worst Case** (default):
- Component fails if ANY linked monitor fails
- Best for critical services requiring 100% availability

**Best Case**:
- Component fails only if ALL monitors fail
- Useful for redundant services with multiple instances

**Weighted Average**:
- Weighted average of monitor statuses
- Good for services with monitors of varying importance

**Majority Vote**:
- Component status based on majority of monitors
- Balanced approach for distributed systems
