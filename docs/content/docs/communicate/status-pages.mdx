- **Past Incidents** — Recent incident history grouped by date
- **Subscribe Button** — Subscribe to receive incident notifications

### Incident Details

Users can click any incident to view the full timeline of updates:

```

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Investigating** | Issue detected, team investigating |
| **Identified** | Root cause found, working on fix |
| **Monitoring** | Fix deployed, monitoring stability |
| **Resolved** | Issue completely resolved |
| **Scheduled** | Planned maintenance |

### Impact Levels

| Impact | Description |

### Incident Updates

Add updates to keep users informed:

1. Open an existing incident
2. Click **Add Update**
3. Write update message
4. Update status if changed
5. Choose whether to notify subscribers

### Scheduled Maintenance

#### How Custom Domains Work

```mermaid

    A[Add CNAME] --> B[Configure in Settings] --> C[Verify DNS] --> D[✅ Active]
    style D fill:#10b981,stroke:#047857,color:#fff
```

#### Step-by-Step Setup

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Add DNS Record**
    
    Log in to your DNS provider (e.g., Cloudflare, GoDaddy, Namecheap) and add a CNAME record:

    | Type | Name | Target |
    |------|------|--------|
    | CNAME | `status` | Your Supercheck domain* |

    <Callout type="info">
    **CNAME Target:**
    - **Cloud users:** Point to `supercheck.io`
    - **Self-hosted:** Point to your `STATUS_PAGE_DOMAIN` value
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Configure in Supercheck**
    
    1. Go to your status page → **Settings** tab
    2. Enter your custom domain (e.g., `status.yourcompany.com`)
    3. Click **Save**
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Verify DNS**
    
    1. Wait 5-15 minutes for DNS propagation
    2. Click **Verify DNS** button
    3. Once verified, your custom domain is active
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **SSL Certificate**
    
    An SSL certificate is automatically provisioned via Let's Encrypt. Your custom domain will serve HTTPS traffic within minutes of verification.
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### DNS Verification

Supercheck verifies your domain by checking that your CNAME record points to the correct target. When you click **Verify DNS**, it resolves your domain and confirms it points to your Supercheck domain.

#### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "CNAME not found" | Wait 15-30 minutes for DNS propagation |
| "Points to wrong target" | Verify CNAME target matches your Supercheck domain |
| "Domain already in use" | The domain is configured on another status page |
| SSL certificate pending | Wait a few minutes after verification |

<Callout type="tip">
**Test DNS Propagation:** Use [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org) to verify your CNAME record has propagated globally.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

### Incident Communication

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Detect Issue] --> B[Create Incident] --> C[Post Updates] --> D[Resolve]
    style A fill:#ef4444,stroke:#b91c1c,color:#fff
    style D fill:#10b981,stroke:#047857,color:#fff
```

**Tips for effective incident communication:**
- **Be transparent** — Share what you know, even if incomplete
- **Update regularly** — Post updates every 30-60 minutes during active incidents
- **Use clear language** — Avoid technical jargon your users won't understand
- **Set expectations** — Provide estimated resolution times when possible

### Organizing Components

- **Use clear names** — "Website" and "API" are better than internal service names
- **Keep it focused** — 5-15 components is ideal for most status pages
- **Add descriptions** — Help users understand what each component does

### Managing Subscribers

- **Enable all channels** — Let users choose email, Slack, or webhooks
- **Enable RSS** — Technical users often prefer RSS feeds
- **Review regularly** — Check the Subscribers tab to see engagement
- **One-click unsubscribe** — Users can unsubscribe anytime via email link

### Custom Domain Tips

- **Use a subdomain** — `status.yourcompany.com` is the industry standard
- **Test before sharing** — Verify your custom domain works before announcing it
- **Allow DNS time** — Wait 15-30 minutes for DNS changes to propagate
