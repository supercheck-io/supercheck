## Alert Configuration

### Monitor Alerts

Configure alerts for each monitor with these options:

**Alert Types**:
- **On Failure**: Notify when monitor status changes to down
- **On Recovery**: Notify when monitor recovers to up
- **On SSL Expiration**: Warn about expiring SSL certificates

**Thresholds**:
- **Failure Threshold**: Number of consecutive failures before alerting (default: 1)
- **Recovery Threshold**: Number of consecutive successes before recovery alert (default: 1)

### Job Alerts

Configure alerts for job executions:

**Alert Types**:
- **On Failure**: Notify when job execution fails
- **On Success**: Notify on successful completion
- **On Timeout**: Notify when job exceeds time limit

**Thresholds**: Same threshold logic as monitors to prevent alert spam.

## Threshold Logic

The threshold system prevents alert fatigue by requiring multiple consecutive failures/successes before triggering notifications.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Monitor/Job
    participant S as System
    participant C as Counter
    participant A as Alert Service
    participant U as User

    M->>S: Execution Fails
    S->>C: Increment Failure Count
    C-->>S: Count = 1
    Note over S: Below Threshold (3)

    M->>S: Execution Fails Again
    S->>C: Increment Failure Count
    C-->>S: Count = 2
    Note over S: Below Threshold (3)

    M->>S: Execution Fails Again
    S->>C: Increment Failure Count
    C-->>S: Count = 3
    Note over S: Threshold Reached!

    S->>A: Trigger Alert
    A->>U: Send Notification

    M->>S: Execution Succeeds
    S->>C: Reset Counter
    C-->>S: Count = 0
    S->>A: Trigger Recovery Alert
    A->>U: Send Recovery Notification
```

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step>Monitor/job executes and fails</Step>
  <Step>System counts consecutive failures</Step>
  <Step>Alert sent only when threshold is reached</Step>
  <Step>Counter resets when status changes</Step>
</Steps>

### Example Scenario

**Monitor with Failure Threshold: 3**

```
10:00 AM: Monitor Down → No Alert (1 consecutive < threshold)
10:05 AM: Still Down   → No Alert (2 consecutive < threshold)
10:10 AM: Still Down   → Alert Sent ✉️ (3 consecutive = threshold)
10:15 AM: Still Down   → No Alert (deduplication prevents spam)
10:20 AM: Monitor Up   → Recovery Alert Sent ✉️
```

### Threshold Benefits

- **Prevents False Alarms**: Requires multiple consecutive failures
- **Reduces Noise**: Avoids alerting on temporary issues
- **Configurable Sensitivity**: Different thresholds for different monitors
- **Recovery Detection**: Separate thresholds for failure and recovery

## Setting Up Alerts

### Step 1: Create Notification Providers

<Steps>
  <Step>Navigate to Settings → Notification Providers</Step>
  <Step>Click "Add Provider" and select your notification type</Step>
  <Step>Configure the provider settings (webhook URL, API keys, etc.)</Step>
  <Step>Test the provider to ensure it works</Step>
  <Step>Save the provider for use in alerts</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Configure Monitor Alerts

<Steps>
  <Step>Edit your monitor configuration</Step>
  <Step>Enable "Alerts" in the alert settings section</Step>
  <Step>Select which notification providers to use</Step>
  <Step>Choose alert types (failure, recovery, SSL expiration)</Step>
  <Step>Set failure and recovery thresholds</Step>
  <Step>Add custom message (optional)</Step>
  <Step>Save your changes</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Configure Job Alerts

<Steps>
  <Step>Edit your job configuration</Step>
  <Step>Enable "Alerts" in the alert settings section</Step>
  <Step>Select notification providers</Step>
  <Step>Choose alert types (failure, success, timeout)</Step>
  <Step>Set thresholds</Step>
  <Step>Save your configuration</Step>
</Steps>

## Alert History

Track all sent alerts in the Alert History page:

### Features
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Every alert logged with timestamp
- **Delivery Status**: See which alerts succeeded or failed
- **Error Messages**: View detailed error information for failed deliveries
- **Filter by Type**: Monitor alerts, job alerts, provider, status
- **Search**: Find specific alerts by message content

### Alert Status Types
- **Sent**: Alert delivered successfully
- **Failed**: Delivery failed (see error message)
- **Pending**: Queued for delivery

## Channel Limits

To ensure system stability and prevent notification overload:

- **Maximum Channels per Monitor**: 10 (configurable via environment)
- **Maximum Channels per Job**: 10 (configurable via environment)

<Callout type="warning">
  Selecting more than the configured limit will show an error. Remove channels before adding new ones.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

### Threshold Configuration

<Steps>
  <Step>Use **Failure Threshold: 2-3** for most monitors to avoid false alarms</Step>
  <Step>Use **Recovery Threshold: 1-2** for quick recovery notifications</Step>
  <Step>Adjust based on monitor frequency and criticality</Step>
  <Step>Test your thresholds with intentional failures</Step>
</Steps>

### Provider Selection

- **Critical Alerts**: Use multiple providers (email + Slack + PagerDuty)
- **Info Alerts**: Single channel (Slack or email)
- **Dev Environments**: Separate providers from production
- **Regular Review**: Audit which alerts are actually actionable

### Custom Messages

Use custom messages to provide context:

```
Production API monitor failed - investigate immediately
Database connection timeout - check RDS health
```

## Troubleshooting

### Email Delivery Failed

<Callout type="warning">
  **Common causes**: Invalid SMTP credentials, unverified sender domain, rate limits
</Callout>

**Solutions**:
1. Verify SMTP configuration in environment variables
2. Check that sender email domain is verified with your provider
3. Test SMTP connection using the provider test endpoint
4. Review SMTP provider logs for specific errors

### Webhook Not Receiving Alerts

**Common causes**: Invalid URL, authentication issues, firewall blocking

**Solutions**:
1. Test webhook endpoint manually with curl
2. Verify authentication headers are correct
3. Check if your firewall allows incoming from Supercheck IPs
4. Review webhook delivery logs in Alert History

### Slack Messages Not Appearing

**Common causes**: Invalid webhook URL, channel permissions

**Solutions**:
1. Verify webhook URL is correct and active
2. Check that Slack app has permission to post in the channel
3. Test with a simple message first
4. Regenerate webhook URL if needed
