# Monitoring & Status Pages

Supercheck monitors help you stay ahead of downtime and keep everyone informed. Use this guide to choose the right monitor, set alerts, and publish status pages your customers can trust.

## Pick the Right Monitor

| Monitor | What it tracks | Use it when |
| ------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| **Journey Monitor** | Full end-to-end flows using your browser tests | Protect checkout, onboarding, or other critical customer paths |
| **API Monitor** | REST or GraphQL responses, latency, headers, and payloads | Verify service health and contract expectations |
| **Website Monitor** | High-level page availability with keyword checks | Catch homepage outages or marketing site issues |
| **Ping Monitor** | Low-level network connectivity | Watch infrastructure nodes and network hops |
| **Port Monitor** | TCP/UDP port availability | Confirm databases and services remain reachable |

## Create Your First Monitor

<Steps>
  <Step>Open **Monitors → New monitor** and choose the type that matches your goal.</Step>
  <Step>Name it plainly so alerts are instantly recognizable.</Step>
  <Step>Set the check frequency (5 minutes works well for most teams).</Step>
  <Step>Define what success looks like — expected status codes, keywords, or response times.</Step>
  <Step>Select who should be alerted and how quickly (email, Slack, webhook).</Step>
  <Step>Test the monitor once before turning it on for continuous coverage.</Step>
</Steps>

## Smart Alerting

- **Failure windows** control how many consecutive failures trigger an alert.
- **Recovery notifications** confirm when things are back to normal.
- **Maintenance windows** pause alerts during planned work.
- **Escalations** send follow-up messages if nobody acknowledges the incident.

## Publish Status Pages

<Tabs items={['Internal', 'Public']}>
  <Tab value="Internal">
    Create a private dashboard for leadership and support teams to see live
    uptime, incidents, and notes.
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Public">
    Share a branded page with customers showing real-time system health,
    historical uptime, and incident timelines.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="note">
  Customize colors, logos, and custom domains so your status page feels like an
  extension of your brand.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

- Group monitors by product or region to keep alerts focused.
- Add links to runbooks or dashboards in the monitor description for quick follow-up.
- Keep incident updates short, timestamped, and honest.
- Review downtime summaries with your team to improve processes.
