Super Admin provides platform-level management for self-hosted deployments, including user management, organization oversight, scheduler control, and system health monitoring.

## Enable Super Admin

There are two ways to enable super admin access:

### Option 1: Environment Variable (Recommended)

Set the `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL` environment variable in your deployment:

```bash
SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yourdomain.com
```

The user with this email is automatically promoted to super admin on login.

### Option 2: Manual Script

Run the bootstrap script inside the app container:

```bash
docker compose exec app npm run setup:admin admin@yourdomain.com
```

### Revoking Super Admin

To downgrade a super admin to organization admin:

```bash
docker compose exec app npm run revoke:admin admin@yourdomain.com
```

## User Management

Manage all users across the platform:

- **View Details** — See user profile, email, and organization memberships
- **Ban/Unban** — Suspend accounts with a reason (banned users cannot log in)
- **Impersonate** — Log in as any user for troubleshooting

### Impersonation

1. Go to **Super Admin → Users**
2. Find the user and click the menu (**⋮**)
3. Select **Impersonate**
4. If the user belongs to multiple organizations, select which one to impersonate into
5. Click **Impersonate User** to confirm

While impersonating:
- A banner at the bottom shows "Impersonating" with the user's email
- Click **Stop** to return to your admin session
- You see the platform exactly as the user would

<Callout type="warning">
**Security Notice**: All impersonation sessions are logged for audit purposes. The original admin ID is preserved throughout the session.
</Callout>

### Banning Users

To suspend a user account:

1. Go to **Super Admin → Users**
2. Find the user and click the menu (**⋮**)
3. Select **Ban User**
4. Enter a reason for the ban (minimum 20 characters)
5. Click **Ban User** to confirm

![Ban User Dialog](/screenshots/super-admin-ban-user.png)

<Callout type="warning">
**Reversible Action**: Banning is reversible. The user will be unable to sign in until unbanned, but all their data is preserved. To unban, click **Unban** from the same menu.
</Callout>

Banned users see a "403 Account suspended" message when attempting to log in.

## Scheduler Control

Manage the job scheduling system:

- **Initialize Schedulers** — Start or restart the scheduling service
- **View Status** — Check scheduler health and active jobs
- **Manual Triggers** — Force-run scheduled jobs for testing

## Security

- **Single Admin** — Only one super admin email is supported per deployment
- **Validation** — Multiple emails in `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL` will cause a startup error
- **Audit Trail** — All super admin actions are logged with timestamps
- **Session Tracking** — Impersonation sessions preserve the original admin ID for accountability
