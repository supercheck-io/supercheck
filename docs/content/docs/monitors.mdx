- Round-trip latency (response time)
- Packet loss percentage

**Best for:**
- Server availability
- Network infrastructure
- VPN endpoints
- Internal services

![Create Ping Monitor](/screenshots/create-ping-monitor.png)

<Callout type="warning">
Some cloud providers and firewalls block ICMP traffic. If ping monitors fail unexpectedly, verify that ICMP is allowed on your target host.
</Callout>

## Port Monitor

Verify that specific services are listening on expected ports.

**What it checks:**
- TCP or UDP port is open and accepting connections
- Connection can be established within timeout
- Service is responding on the specified port

**Best for:**
- Database servers (PostgreSQL 5432, MySQL 3306)
- Cache servers (Redis 6379, Memcached 11211)
- Mail servers (SMTP 25/587, IMAP 993)
- Custom services on non-standard ports

![Create Port Monitor](/screenshots/create-port-monitor.png)

## Synthetic Monitor

Run full Playwright browser tests on a schedule to validate complete user flows.

**What it checks:**
- Complete user journeys (login, checkout, form submission)
- JavaScript-rendered content
- Multi-step workflows
- Visual elements and interactions

**Best for:**
- Critical user flows (login, signup, checkout)
- Single-page applications (SPAs)
- Complex workflows requiring browser interaction
- End-to-end validation of user experience

**How it works:**
1. Create a Playwright test in the [Playground](/docs/automate/playground)
2. Save the test to your project
3. Create a Synthetic Monitor and select your test
4. Set the check interval (minimum 5 minutes recommended)
5. Monitor runs your test and reports pass/fail status

![Create Synthetic Monitor](/screenshots/create-synthetic-monitor.png)

<Callout type="info">
Set synthetic monitor intervals longer than your test execution time to prevent overlapping runs. For a test that takes 2 minutes, use a 5+ minute interval.
</Callout>

## Multi-Region Monitoring

Run checks from multiple geographic locations to detect regional outages and measure latency from different parts of the world.

![Multi-Location Selector](/screenshots/create-monitor-mutilocation-selector.png)

### Available Regions

| Region | Location |
|--------|----------|
| **US East** | Ashburn, Virginia, USA |
| **EU Central** | Nuremberg, Germany |
| **Asia Pacific** | Singapore |

### How Multi-Region Works

When you enable multiple regions, checks run independently from each location and results are aggregated to determine overall status.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App
    participant US as US East
    participant EU as EU Central
    participant AP as Asia Pacific
    participant DB as Database

    App->>US: Queue check
    App->>EU: Queue check
    App->>AP: Queue check
    US->>DB: Save result
    EU->>DB: Save result
    AP->>DB: Save result
    DB->>App: Aggregate status
```

**Status calculation:** Once all locations report, the system calculates overall status. A monitor is "Up" if the majority of locations report success.

<Callout type="info">
**Self-Hosted Deployments**: In self-hosted mode, all region selections execute from your single worker location. The multi-region selector is available for configuration consistency, but checks run sequentially from one location. For true geographic distribution, deploy workers in multiple regions.
</Callout>

## Alert Configuration

Configure when and how you receive notifications about monitor status changes.

![Alert Settings](/screenshots/create-monitor-alerts-setting.png)

### Alert Settings

| Setting | Description | Recommended |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Enable Alerts** | Turn notifications on/off for this monitor | On for production services |
| **Alert on Failure** | Notify when monitor exceeds failure threshold | Always enable |
| **Alert on Recovery** | Notify when monitor returns to healthy state | Enable for critical services |
| **Failure Threshold** | Consecutive failures before alerting (1-5) | 2-3 to avoid false positives |
| **Recovery Threshold** | Consecutive successes before recovery alert (1-5) | 2 to confirm stability |
| **Notification Channels** | Which providers receive alerts | Multiple channels for critical services |

### Threshold Logic

Thresholds prevent alert fatigue from transient issues:

<Tabs items={['How It Works', 'Example']}>
<Tab value="How It Works">

**Failure Threshold**

The number of consecutive failures required before sending the first failure alert. This prevents alerts from single network blips.

**Recovery Threshold**

The number of consecutive successes required before sending a recovery alert. This ensures the service is truly stable before confirming recovery.

**Alert Limiting**

- Maximum **3 alerts** per failure or recovery sequence
- Counter resets when status changes

</Tab>
<Tab value="Example">

**Configuration:** Failure Threshold = 3, Recovery Threshold = 2

| Check | Result | Consecutive Count | Alert Sent |
|-------|--------|-------------------|------------|
| 1 | ❌ Fail | 1 failure | — |
| 2 | ❌ Fail | 2 failures | — |
| 3 | ❌ Fail | 3 failures ✓ | **Failure Alert** |
| 4 | ❌ Fail | 4 failures | — |
| 5 | ✅ Pass | 1 success | — |
| 6 | ✅ Pass | 2 successes ✓ | **Recovery Alert** |

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info">
A threshold of 2-3 works well for most services. Use 1 only for extremely critical services where any failure requires immediate attention.
</Callout>

## Monitor Details Page

The monitor details page provides comprehensive visibility into your monitor's health, performance, and history.

![Monitor Details Page](/screenshots/monitor-details.png)

| **15 minutes** | Less critical services | Reduced resource usage |
| **30-60 minutes** | Low-priority or development | Minimal resource usage |

<Callout type="info">
**Synthetic Monitors**: Minimum interval is 5 minutes to prevent overlapping Playwright executions. Set intervals longer than your test execution time—for a 2-minute test, use 5+ minute intervals.
</Callout>

## Tags

Organize monitors with color-coded tags for easy filtering and categorization.

- **Create tags** — Add custom tags with any of 8 available colors
- **Filter by tags** — Quickly find monitors by tag in the list view
- **Bulk operations** — Apply or remove tags from multiple monitors

Tags are project-scoped, so each project can have its own tagging system.
