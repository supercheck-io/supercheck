## HTTP Monitor

The most versatile monitor type for APIs and web services.

**What it checks:**
- HTTP/HTTPS endpoint availability
- Response status codes (2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx)
- Response time and latency
- Response body content (keyword validation)
- JSON response structure (JSON path validation)
- SSL certificate validity and expiration

**Configuration options:**
- **HTTP Method** — GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, OPTIONS
- **Custom Headers** — Add authentication tokens, API keys, or custom headers
- **Request Body** — Send JSON or form data for POST/PUT requests
- **Authentication** — Basic Auth or Bearer Token support
- **Expected Status** — Validate specific status codes or ranges
- **Keyword Validation** — Check for presence or absence of text in response

![Create HTTP Monitor](/screenshots/create-http-monitor.png)

<Callout type="info">
Use HTTP monitors for APIs, health check endpoints, and any service that responds to HTTP requests.
</Callout>

## Website Monitor

Simplified monitoring for web pages with built-in SSL tracking.

**What it checks:**
- Page loads successfully (HTTP 200)
- SSL certificate is valid
- SSL certificate expiration date
- Optional keyword presence on page

**Best for:**
- Marketing websites
- Landing pages
- Public-facing web applications
- SSL certificate expiration alerts

## Ping Monitor

Network-level monitoring using ICMP ping.

**What it checks:**
- Host is reachable on the network
- Round-trip latency (response time)
- Packet loss percentage

**Best for:**
- Server availability
- Network infrastructure
- VPN endpoints
- Internal services

![Create Ping Monitor](/screenshots/create-ping-monitor.png)

<Callout type="warning">
Some cloud providers and firewalls block ICMP traffic. If ping monitors fail unexpectedly, verify that ICMP is allowed on your target host.
</Callout>

## Port Monitor

Verify that specific services are listening on expected ports.

**What it checks:**
- TCP or UDP port is open and accepting connections
- Connection can be established within timeout
- Service is responding on the specified port

**Best for:**
- Database servers (PostgreSQL 5432, MySQL 3306)
- Cache servers (Redis 6379, Memcached 11211)
- Mail servers (SMTP 25/587, IMAP 993)
- Custom services on non-standard ports

## Synthetic Monitor

Run full Playwright browser tests on a schedule to validate complete user flows.

**What it checks:**
- Complete user journeys (login, checkout, form submission)
- JavaScript-rendered content
- Multi-step workflows
- Visual elements and interactions

**Best for:**
- Critical user flows (login, signup, checkout)
- Single-page applications (SPAs)
- Complex workflows requiring browser interaction
- End-to-end validation of user experience

**How it works:**
1. Create a Playwright test in the [Playground](/docs/automate/playground)
2. Save the test to your project
3. Create a Synthetic Monitor and select your test
4. Set the check interval (minimum 5 minutes recommended)
5. Monitor runs your test and reports pass/fail status

![Create Synthetic Monitor](/screenshots/create-synthetic-monitor.png)

<Callout type="info">
Set synthetic monitor intervals longer than your test execution time to prevent overlapping runs. For a test that takes 2 minutes, use a 5+ minute interval.
</Callout>

## Multi-Region Monitoring

Run checks from multiple geographic locations to detect regional outages and measure latency from different parts of the world.

![Multi-Location Selector](/screenshots/create-monitor-mutilocation-selector.png)

### Available Regions

| Region | Location | Best For |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **US East** | Ashburn, Virginia, USA | North American users, US-hosted services |
| **EU Central** | Nuremberg, Germany | European users, GDPR-compliant monitoring |
| **Asia Pacific** | Singapore | Asian users, APAC-hosted services |

### How Multi-Region Works

When you enable multiple regions:
1. Each region runs the check independently
2. Results are collected from all locations
3. Status is aggregated (worst-case by default)
4. You can see per-region latency and availability

**Use cases:**
- Detect CDN or DNS issues affecting specific regions
- Measure latency from different geographic locations
- Ensure global availability for international users
- Identify regional network problems

<Callout type="info">
**Self-Hosted Deployments**: In self-hosted mode, all region selections execute from your single worker location. The multi-region selector is available for configuration consistency, but checks run sequentially from one location. For true geographic distribution, deploy workers in multiple regions.
</Callout>

## Alert Configuration

Configure when and how you receive notifications about monitor status changes.

![Alert Settings](/screenshots/create-monitor-alerts-setting.png)

### Alert Settings

| Setting | Description | Recommended |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Enable Alerts** | Turn notifications on/off for this monitor | On for production services |
| **Alert on Failure** | Notify when monitor exceeds failure threshold | Always enable |
| **Alert on Recovery** | Notify when monitor returns to healthy state | Enable for critical services |
| **Failure Threshold** | Consecutive failures before alerting (1-5) | 2-3 to avoid false positives |
| **Recovery Threshold** | Consecutive successes before recovery alert (1-5) | 2 to confirm stability |
| **Notification Channels** | Which providers receive alerts | Multiple channels for critical services |

### Threshold Logic

Thresholds prevent alert fatigue from transient issues:

**Example with Failure Threshold = 3:**

| Check # | Result | Failure Count | Alert Sent? |
|---------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | ❌ Fail | 1/3 | No |
| 2 | ❌ Fail | 2/3 | No |
| 3 | ❌ Fail | 3/3 | **Yes - Failure Alert** |
| 4 | ✅ Pass | Reset to 0 | **Yes - Recovery Alert** |

<Callout type="info">
A threshold of 2-3 works well for most services. Use 1 only for extremely critical services where any failure requires immediate attention.
</Callout>

## Monitor Status

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Up** | All checks passing | No action needed |
| **Degraded** | Some checks failing, below threshold | Investigate potential issues |
| **Down** | Failure threshold exceeded | Alerts sent, investigate immediately |
| **Paused** | Monitoring disabled | Re-enable when ready |

## Check Intervals

| Interval | Best For | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **1 minute** | Critical production APIs | Fastest detection, highest resource usage |
| **5 minutes** | Standard production services | Good balance of speed and efficiency |
| **15 minutes** | Less critical services | Reduced resource usage |
| **30-60 minutes** | Low-priority or development | Minimal resource usage |

<Callout type="info">
**Synthetic Monitors**: Minimum interval is 5 minutes to prevent overlapping Playwright executions. Set intervals longer than your test execution time—for a 2-minute test, use 5+ minute intervals.
</Callout>

## Best Practices

### General Recommendations
- **Use multiple regions** for production services to detect regional issues
- **Set appropriate thresholds** (2-3) to avoid false positive alerts
- **Configure recovery alerts** to know when issues are resolved
- **Use descriptive names** that identify the service and environment

### HTTP Monitors
- **Set realistic timeouts** based on your service's normal response time
- **Validate response content** to catch partial failures
- **Monitor health check endpoints** rather than heavy pages
- **Use authentication** for private endpoints

### Synthetic Monitors
- **Keep tests focused** on critical user paths
- **Set intervals longer than test duration** to prevent overlap
- **Use stable selectors** (data-testid, aria-labels) for reliability
- **Handle dynamic content** with appropriate waits

### SSL Monitoring
- **Enable SSL expiration alerts** at 30, 14, and 7 days before expiry
- **Monitor all domains** including subdomains and CDN certificates
- **Set up renewal reminders** well before expiration

## Tags

Organize monitors with color-coded tags for easy filtering and categorization.

- **Create tags** — Add custom tags with any of 8 available colors
- **Filter by tags** — Quickly find monitors by tag in the list view
- **Bulk operations** — Apply or remove tags from multiple monitors

Tags are project-scoped, so each project can have its own tagging system.
