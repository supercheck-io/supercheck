# k6 Performance Testing Implementation - Summary

## ✅ Completed Implementation

I've successfully implemented the k6 performance testing feature for Supercheck following the implementation plan. Here's what has been completed:

### 1. **Database Schema** ✅
- **Location**: `app/src/db/schema/k6Runs.ts` & `worker/src/db/schema/k6Runs.ts`
- Created `k6_performance_runs` table with:
  - Full metrics tracking (requests, response times, p95, p99)
  - S3 artifact URLs (report, summary, console logs)
  - Location-based execution tracking
  - Threshold pass/fail status
- **Types Updated**: `app/src/db/schema/types.ts`
  - Added `K6Location` type: `"us-east" | "eu-central" | "asia-pacific"`
  - Added `"performance"` to `TestType`
  - Added `"k6"` to `JobType`
- **Schema Exports**: Both app and worker schema index files updated

### 2. **k6 Validator** ✅
- **Location**: `app/src/lib/k6-validator.ts`
- Validates k6 scripts for:
  - Required k6 imports
  - Default export function
  - Forbidden Node.js modules
  - Async/await usage (not supported in k6)
  - Best practices warnings
- Includes location metadata and helper functions
- Provides k6 script template via `getK6ScriptTemplate()`

### 3. **Worker Implementation** ✅

#### K6ExecutionService
- **Location**: `worker/src/k6/services/k6-execution.service.ts`
- Executes k6 binary with proper arguments
- Streams console output to Redis for real-time viewing
- Generates web dashboard report (k6's built-in HTML report)
- Exports summary.json for metrics extraction
- Handles concurrency limits (configurable, default: 3)
- Uploads all artifacts to S3

#### K6ExecutionProcessor
- **Location**: `worker/src/k6/processors/k6-execution.processor.ts`
- Processes jobs from `k6-execution` BullMQ queue
- **Location filtering logic** for multi-region support:
  - Checks `ENABLE_LOCATION_FILTERING` env var
  - Skips jobs that don't match worker's location
  - Supports MVP mode (filtering disabled) and production mode (filtering enabled)
- Extracts metrics from k6 summary.json
- Updates database with results and artifacts

#### K6 Module
- **Location**: `worker/src/k6/k6.module.ts`
- Registers k6 queue and services
- Integrated into `worker/src/app.module.ts`

#### S3Service Update
- **Location**: `worker/src/execution/services/s3.service.ts`
- Added `k6PerformanceBucketName` property
- Updated `getBucketForEntityType()` to handle `'k6_performance'`
- Creates k6 bucket on module initialization

#### Dockerfile
- **Location**: `worker/Dockerfile`
- Installs k6 v0.49.0 from official GitHub releases
- Verifies installation with `k6 version`
- Sets `K6_BIN_PATH` environment variable
- Creates `k6-reports` directory with proper permissions

### 4. **Backend API Routes** ✅

#### Test Execution Endpoint
- **Location**: `app/src/app/api/tests/[id]/execute/route.ts`
- Handles both Playwright and k6 test execution
- Creates run record in database
- Validates k6 scripts before execution
- Enqueues to appropriate queue (`k6-execution` or `test-execution`)
- Accepts `location` parameter for k6 tests

#### SSE Console Streaming
- **Location**: `app/src/app/api/runs/[runId]/stream/route.ts`
- Server-Sent Events endpoint for real-time console streaming
- Subscribes to Redis pub/sub channel: `k6:run:{runId}:console`
- Polls run status every 2 seconds to detect completion
- Sends heartbeat every 30 seconds
- Properly cleans up connections on abort

### 5. **Frontend Implementation** ✅

#### Sidebar Update
- **Location**: `app/src/components/app-sidebar.tsx`
- Added "Performance Test" menu item with Zap icon (purple color)
- Links to `/playground?scriptType=performance`

#### Playground Updates
- **Location**: `app/src/app/(main)/playground/page.tsx`
- Added "performance" case to breadcrumbs generation

- **Location**: `app/src/components/playground/index.tsx`
- Added "performance" to allowed script types array
- Template loading via script-service

#### Script Service
- **Location**: `app/src/lib/script-service.ts`
- Added `Performance` to `ScriptType` enum
- Added comprehensive k6 script template with:
  - HTTP GET request example
  - Virtual users configuration
  - Duration settings
  - Thresholds (p95 < 500ms, error rate < 10%)
  - Check functions
  - Best practices documentation

## 🔧 Installation & Configuration

### 1. Install k6 Locally (Development)

The worker automatically detects k6 if it's in your PATH. See **`K6_LOCAL_INSTALLATION.md`** for detailed instructions.

**Quick Install:**

```bash
# macOS
brew install k6

# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo gpg -k
sudo gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/k6-archive-keyring.gpg --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys C5AD17C747E3415A3642D57D77C6C491D6AC1D69
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/k6-archive-keyring.gpg] https://dl.k6.io/deb stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/k6.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install k6

# Windows (Chocolatey)
choco install k6

# Verify
k6 version
```

### 2. Worker Configuration

Add these to `worker/.env`:

```bash
# k6 Configuration (optional - auto-detected if in PATH)
# Only set this if k6 is in a non-standard location
# K6_BIN_PATH=/usr/local/bin/k6  # Uncomment if needed

K6_MAX_CONCURRENCY=3

# Worker Location (choose one per worker instance)
WORKER_LOCATION=us-east
# Options: us-east | eu-central | asia-pacific

# Location Filtering
# Set to false for MVP (single worker processes all jobs)
# Set to true for multi-region (workers only process matching location jobs)
ENABLE_LOCATION_FILTERING=false

# S3 K6 Bucket
S3_K6_PERFORMANCE_BUCKET_NAME=supercheck-performance-artifacts
```

**Path Handling**: The worker automatically handles k6 binary location:
- **Local Dev**: Uses `k6` from PATH (no config needed)
- **Docker/Production**: Uses `/usr/local/bin/k6`
- **Custom**: Set `K6_BIN_PATH` environment variable

## 📋 Required Next Steps

### 1. Database Migrations ⚠️
You need to create and run migrations for the new `k6_performance_runs` table:

```bash
# In app directory
cd app
npm run db:generate  # Generate migration from schema
npm run db:migrate   # Run migration
```

**Migration should include**:
- Create `k6_performance_runs` table
- Add `location` column to `runs` table
- Update `tests.type` enum to include 'performance'
- Update `jobs.job_type` enum to include 'k6'

### 2. Install k6 Binary
Install k6 on your local machine for development. See **`K6_LOCAL_INSTALLATION.md`** for detailed instructions.

Quick install:
```bash
# macOS
brew install k6

# Verify
k6 version
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Make sure these packages are installed:

```bash
# In app directory
npm install bullmq ioredis

# In worker directory
npm install bullmq ioredis
```

**Note**: We use native `crypto.randomUUID()` for IDs (no external UUID library needed)

### 4. Test the Implementation

#### Basic Flow Test:
1. Start the worker: `cd worker && npm run start:dev`
2. Start the app: `cd app && npm run dev`
3. Navigate to `/playground?scriptType=performance`
4. You should see the k6 script template
5. Click "Run" (location selector dialog should appear)
6. Select a location and confirm
7. Test should execute and stream console output
8. After completion, HTML report should display

### 5. Features NOT YET Implemented
Based on the plan, these components still need implementation:

#### Console Streaming Components (Frontend)
- **Needed**: `app/src/components/runs/console-stream.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Real-time console viewer with auto-scroll
- **Uses**: EventSource API to consume SSE endpoint

#### Performance Report Component (Frontend)
- **Needed**: `app/src/components/playground/performance-test-report.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Shows live console during execution, then switches to HTML report
- **Features**: Status polling, iframe for k6 dashboard

#### Location Selection Dialog (Frontend)
- **Needed**: `app/src/components/playground/location-dialog.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Modal to select execution location before running test
- **Options**: US East, EU Central, Asia Pacific

#### K6 Metrics Grid (Frontend)
- **Needed**: `app/src/components/runs/k6-metrics-grid.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Display key metrics (requests, response times, error rate)
- **Location**: Run detail pages

#### Job Form Updates
- **Needed**: Updates to `app/src/components/jobs/job-form.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Add k6 job type selector and location picker
- **Features**: Filter tests by compatibility (k6 jobs only show performance tests)

#### Run Detail Page Updates
- **Needed**: Updates to run detail pages to show k6-specific data
- **Purpose**: Display location badge, metrics, and HTML report for k6 runs

## 🚀 Deployment Modes

### Mode 1: MVP (Single Worker)
```bash
WORKER_LOCATION=us-east
ENABLE_LOCATION_FILTERING=false
```
- Location is stored but not enforced
- One worker processes all k6 jobs
- Quick to deploy and test

### Mode 2: Multi-Region (Production)
Deploy 3 worker instances:

**Worker 1 (US East)**
```bash
WORKER_LOCATION=us-east
ENABLE_LOCATION_FILTERING=true
```

**Worker 2 (EU Central)**
```bash
WORKER_LOCATION=eu-central
ENABLE_LOCATION_FILTERING=true
```

**Worker 3 (Asia Pacific)**
```bash
WORKER_LOCATION=asia-pacific
ENABLE_LOCATION_FILTERING=true
```

- Each worker only processes jobs for its location
- True geo-distributed load testing
- Jobs route automatically based on user-selected location
